This repo is the Biothings plugin for _DDInter_. The requirements were discussed in [pending.api - Issue#68](https://github.com/biothings/pending.api/issues/68). The data files in use are the eight `csv` datasheets available in the [download page](http://ddinter.scbdd.com/download/), and a [`drug_data.json`](drug_data.json) generated by [`webscraper.py`](webscraper.py).
